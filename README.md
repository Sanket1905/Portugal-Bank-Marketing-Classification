The project aims to analyze the Portuguese Bank Marketing dataset and predict whether the client will subscribe to the term deposit.

Description	

●	Analyzed a dataset comprising 41,188 client records and 21 attributes to predict subscription to term deposits, conducting thorough exploratory data analysis including cleaning, manipulation, and multicollinearity assessment using VIF.

●	Employed various classification models such as logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, achieving a superior accuracy of 91.35% with a Random Forest model using bagging techniques.

●	Tabulated performance metrics of all models, conducted model tuning and determined Random Forest with bagging as the most effective predictor for term deposit subscriptions.
